INTRODUCTION

TierraCrossSection is a cross-section that is modeled after original hapi. It contains functionalities to generate different version of the cross-section for Tierra, a transmission spectroscopy code that is developed by the disruptive planet group at EAPS, MIT. This code generates the cross-section database to be used into the transmission spectra with the transmission spectra using the HITRAN/HITEMP database.
