INTRODUCTION
----------------
HAPILite is a lighter version of hapi. It contains different function that are scraped from the original hapi, and is meant to remove the functionalities that are usually not required for exo-planetary transmission or emission retrieval such as those related to the air broadening or isotopic abundances. This set of code will focus on propagating the errors during the cross-section generation and its effect on the atmospheric retrieval, a paper in preparation (Niraula et al. in prep)

TO DO LIST
-------------------
  1. Use DataMatrix to generate the database to be used into the transmission spectra with the transmission spectra.
  2. Write a batch script to generate the cross-sections from beginning to end.
  2. Check the generated the cross-section against different
  3. Add the effect of diluent such as Hydrogen and Helium effects on the broadening, and the shift where the parameters are unavailable.
